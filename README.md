# 🧠 PaddleOCR Reverse UML

This repository provides UML diagrams and architectural documentation of the **PaddleOCR** project, generated via reverse engineering for research and educational purposes.

Understanding the internal structure of PaddleOCR can be complex due to its modularity and deep learning components. This project aims to make it more accessible by offering structured visual models and technical analysis.

## 📄 Included Documents

- **OCR_IA_Bibliotecas_Documentacao.pdf**  
  UML diagrams and a technical overview of the main libraries used in PaddleOCR.

- **Relatorio_Ambiente_OCR_IA.pdf**  
  Summary of the software environment, versions, and tools used during the reverse engineering process.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to help:
- 🧑‍💻 Developers better understand how PaddleOCR is structured internally  
- 🎓 Students and researchers learn from a practical, real-world software example  
- 🧩 Contributors quickly grasp the components and dependencies of the PaddleOCR codebase

By presenting clean and organized diagrams, this repository serves as a learning and onboarding tool.
